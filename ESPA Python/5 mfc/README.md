You can count the number of occurrences of each character in a string. For example, for an input string ¡°Happy Python¡± the character ¡®a¡¯ appears once and the ¡®y¡¯ appears twice. 

Write a program printing the most frequent character in an input string. Your program should ignore the case, which implies that the capital letters and lower letters should not be discriminated. Hence, your program should print ¡®P¡¯ for the input string ¡°Happy Python.¡± 

Only alphabets should be counted, which implies that the most frequent character of the string ¡°Oops!!!¡± should be ¡®O¡¯ rather than ¡®!¡¯

If the string contains several characters which are most frequent, print the most frequent character which comes first in the alphabetic order.

In the input file, a line of character string is given. Your program should print the most frequent character as a capital letter.
