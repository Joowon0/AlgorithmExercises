## minmax.py
Read two integers, x and y, and calculate the sum (x + y), the product (x * y), and the subtraction (x ? y). Finally, calculate the minimum and the maximum of them.

For instance, assume that two numbers, 3 and ?5, are given in the input file. Then the three results are ?2, ?15, 8; and the minimum of ?15 and the maximum is 8.

Assume the names of the input and the output files are ¡°minmax.inp¡± and ¡°minmax.out¡± respectively. Your source file should be named as ¡°minmax.py¡± with ¡°.py¡± is an extension.

In the input file, the integers are given in separate lines.

Your program should write the minimum and the maximum in sequence for each output line. 
INPUT minmax.inp     | OUTPUT minmax.out    
--- | ---
3 <br> -5         | -15 <br> 8
3 <br> -2         | -6   <br> 5
10 <br> 20        | -10   <br> 200
-10 <br> -20    | -30   <br> 200
0 <br> -2         | -2   <br> 2
