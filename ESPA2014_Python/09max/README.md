## max.py

You have a square matrix in the input file abd you are going to find the row, the column, or the diagonal which contains the maximum sum of elements.  

For example, if the following matrix is given:
```
20 10 7
25 30 45
10 9 13
```
the maximum sum of elements in a row, a column, or a diagonal is 100, the sume of the second row.

In the input file, the elements of the matrix are given row by row. A line of the input file contains a row where the elements are separated by a space. If any diagonal shows the maximum, it should be printed. Your program should print the maximum sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals.
