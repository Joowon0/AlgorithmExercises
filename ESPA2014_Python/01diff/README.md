## diff.py
Read two integers, each of which is written in a line of the input file.

Then you can calculate the difference d of two integers n1 and n2 using the following equation: d = max(n1, n2) - min(n1, n2).

For instance, assume that the integers read are n1 = 31 and n2 = -9. Then, the difference of them is 40 since n1 is the max of them and n2, the min.

Assume the names of the input and the output files are ¡°diff.inp¡± and ¡°diff.out¡± respectively.

In the input file, each integer is given in a single line. Your program should write the difference in a single line.
