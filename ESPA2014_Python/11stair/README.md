## stair.py

Led is jumping up the stairs. He can go either one step or two steps at once. Zeppeline, the friend of Led, wants to count the number of different ways of Led's going up the stair consisting of N steps.

For example, if the stair consists of just 1 step, there's only one way. However, if it consists of three steps, Led can go up in the following three ways: (1, 1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1).

Write a program to help Zeppeline to count the number of different ways of Led's going up the stair ways where the number of steps N is given as input. 

In the input file, the number of steps N is given. Your program should print the the number of different ways of Led's going up the stair consisting of N steps.

HINT: It is better to derive a recurrence equation for counting the number of different ways.
