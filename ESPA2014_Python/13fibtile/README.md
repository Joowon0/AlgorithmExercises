The fibonacci number can make the subsequent tiling of squares, as in Fig. 1, whose side lengths are the fibonacci numbers.

Write a program to determine a rectangle is a possible fibonacci tiling. The side lengths of the rectangle are given in the input file separated by a space.

In the input file, the side lengths of the square are given in the non-decreasing order. Your program should print ¡°YES¡± if it is a square which can be built by fibonacci tiling, ¡°NO,¡± otherwise.
